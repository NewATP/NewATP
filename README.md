## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**NewATP/NewATP** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on meeting new people that will help grow...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **coding with Python and cybersedcurity ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on writing content or any contribution work for any project that would permit me to expand my knowledge in open source
...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **created repositories I have no idea what i am doing so I wrongly created four new projects
...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... **Anything that you see fit and would make grow together I will accept respectful criticism because this is the key to my growth     
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: anyway you find fit I am always open...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: get overstacked with overwellness pretty often  ...
-->  ## Please stay respectful as I am new to this and my ultimate goal is to learn & contribute to this community.
## I read a tutorial that suggested to contribute before starting a project  
## I can suggest other poeple to do the same but not really because I was afraid to dive in but I can contribute and with the communinity I am convinced that you will show me that way
## Please be authentic I realize that their are many tools to aid me in this new venture and I will never pretend to do or be something I am not or does not represent me
